Suppose we want to open a database connection that can be reused across multiple runs of a Streamlit app. For this you can make use of the fact that cached objects are stored by reference to automatically initialize and reuse the connection:
Use the allow_output_mutation=True flag to suppress the immutability check. This prevents Streamlit from trying to hash the output connection, and also turns off Streamlitâ€™s mutation warning in the process.
